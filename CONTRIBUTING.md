# How to Contribute

If you want to contribute to this repository, you can either contribute to challenges or solutions


## Challenges

Here are some of the known issues with the repository that you could potentially help with:

- Missing Challenges
- Inconsistency between title formatting i.e. `[hard] vs [Hard] vs [Difficult]`, ordering of words, lowercase vs uppercase letters, etc (take a look at the challenge names to see the inconsistencies)
    -   This has been largely handled, but feel free to update anything that was missed.
- Missing selftext for some challenge titles (Issue #4)
- Missing standard input file required to run challenge (often linked in challenge text)

#### Naming Format

Please use the following name format when creating a challenge directory:

`Challenge xxxx Easy/Intermediate/Hard - Challenge Name`

Example:

```
Challenge 0251 Hard - ASCII Nonogram
Challenge 0254 Intermediate - Finding Legal Reversi Moves
Challenge 0253 Easy - Unconditional Loan Income
```

## Solutions

This repository's main purpose is to serve as an external repo for r/dailyprogrammer challenges. However, with the help of others, we can build a solution bank for each challenge.

In order to submit your solution:

1. Go to the directory of the challenge you've solved
2. Add your solution with the following format `solution.<filetype>`, to the `solutions/` folder *(please add it in if it does not already exist)*.

-------------
The best thing to do is to try and build a **diverse** solution bank, meaning solutions in different programming languages, for each challenge.

If you see that there is an existing solution in the language you used, you can still add your solution so long as you add it under the name `solutionX.<filetype>`, where X is an integer representing the Xth solution after the first solution.


Example:
```
solution.py
solution1.py
solution2.py
...
solutionX.py
```

#### Author Credit & Descriptions

If you want your name, reddit username, github handle, what have you, to be included, just add a header comment to your file
In Python for example, you can use `""" some text """`, and in Java you can use `/* Some text here */`.

Also, if you can, please include a description of your solution so that users can understand your approach, and either take their own unique approach, or compare theirs to yours.

**Example:**

```
/***************************

 * Description: A short description 
 * Long Description: See above example.
